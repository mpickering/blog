title: About
---

I am a Senior Haskell Consultant working for Well-Typed LLP. My area of expertise
is in GHC development. I have contributed too all parts of the compiler but my
specialities are profiling (time and memory), the compilation driver and anything
to do with wider ecosystem integration.

Before this, I was a PhD student at the University of Bristol supervised by
Dr Nicolas Wu. My research interests are to do with functional programming,
in particular I am interested staged metaprogramming.

Previously I studied Computer Science & Philosophy at the University of Oxford.
