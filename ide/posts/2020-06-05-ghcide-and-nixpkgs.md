A few weeks ago I got [ghcide](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide) into
[nixpkgs, the package set of the package manager nix and the distribution
nixos](https://nixos.org/nixos). Mind you, that was not a brave act of heroism
or dark wizardry. Once I grasped the structure of the nixpkgs Haskell
ecosystem, it was actually pretty easy. In this post I want to share my
experience and tell you what I learned about the nixpkgs Haskell infrastructure
and ghcide.

This post has four parts:

1. Why can installing ghcide go wrong?
2. How can you install ghcide on nix today?
3. The nixpkgs Haskell ecosystem and dependency resolution
4. How ghcide got fixed in nixpkgs

## 1. Why can installing ghcide go wrong?

Haskell development tooling setup is infamous for being brittle and hard to
setup. Every other day when someone asks on reddit or in the `#haskell`
channel, inescapably there will come at least one answer of the form "It’s not
worth the pain. Just use ghcid." I guess one point of this blog series is that
this does not have to be the case anymore.

So, what were the reasons for this resignation? One is certainly that
[`ghcid`](https://github.com/ndmitchell/ghcid) is a really great and easy to
use tool. I think it‘s clear that a well done language server can leverage
you much further and to me `ghcide` has already proven this.

### Compile your project and ghcide with the same ghc!

One source of frustration is likely that successfully setting up a language
server that is deeply interwoven with `ghc` like `ghcide` has one very
important requirement. **You need to compile `ghcide` with the same `ghc`
(version) as your project.** This shouldn‘t be hard to achieve nowadays - I’ll
show how to do it if you use `nix` in this blogpost and I assume it‘s the
default in other setups - but if you fail to meet this requirement you are in
for a lot of trouble.

So why exactly do we need to use "the same ghc" and what does that even mean?
Frankly I am not totally sure. I am not a `ghcide` developer. I guess sometimes
you can get away with some slight deviations, but the general recommendation is
to use the same `ghc` version. I can tell you three situations that will cause
problems or have caused problems for me:

1. Using another `ghc` release. E.g. using `ghcide` compiled with `ghc` 8.8 on
   a `ghc` 8.6 project I get:

   ```plain
   Step 4/6, Cradle 1/1: Loading GHC Session
   ghcide: /nix/store/3ybbc3vag4mpwaqglpdac4v413na3vhl-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/HSghc-prim-0.5.3.o: unknown symbol `stg_atomicModifyMutVarzh'
   ghcide: ghcide: unable to load package `ghc-prim-0.5.3'
   ```

2. Using the same `ghc` version but linked against different external libraries
   like `glibc`. This [can
   happen](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide/issues/404) when [different
   releases](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide/issues/538) of nixpkgs are
   involved. This could look like this:

   ```plain
   Step 4/6, Cradle 1/1: Loading GHC Session
   ghcide: <command line>: can't load .so/.DLL for: /nix/store/hz3nwwc0k32ygvjn63gw8gm0nf9gprd8-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so (/nix/store/6yaj6n8l925xxfbcd65gzqx3dz7idrnn-glibc-2.27/lib/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.29' not found (required by /nix/store/hz3nwwc0k32ygvjn63gw8gm0nf9gprd8-ghc-8.6.5/lib/ghc-8.6.5/ghc-prim-0.5.3/libHSghc-prim-0.5.3-ghc8.6.5.so))
   ```
   or like this

```plain
   Unexpected usage error
   can't load .so/.DLL for: /nix/store/pnd2kl27sag76h23wa5kl95a76n3k9i3-glibc-2.27/lib/libpthread.so
   (/nix/store/pnd2kl27sag76h23wa5kl95a76n3k9i3-glibc-2.27/lib/libpthread.so.0: undefined symbol:
   __libc_vfork, version GLIBC_PRIVATE)
   ```

3. Using the same `ghc` release but with a patch to `ghc`. This e.g. happened
   to me while using the [`obelisk`
   framework](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk) which uses a modified
   `ghc`.

To sum up, both ghcs should come from the same source and be linked against the
same libraries. Your best bet is to use the same binary. But that is not
necessary.

## 2. How can you install ghcide on nix today?

When you want to use `ghcide` with nix you now have two options. Either
[`haskellPackages.ghcide`](https://nixos.org/nixos/packages.html?query=ghcide)
from nixpkgs or [`ghcide-nix`](https://github.com/cachix/ghcide-nix) which uses
the [`haskell.nix` ecosystem](https://github.com/input-output-hk/haskell.nix).
I will describe both solutions and their pros and cons from my point of view.

### haskellPackages.ghcide

First make sure you are on a new enough version of nixpkgs. You can try
installing `ghcide` user or system wide, with e.g. `nix-env -iA
haskellPackages.ghcide` or via your `configuration.nix` on nixos. But that has
a greater danger of being incompatible with the `ghc` you are using in your
specific project.
The less brittle and more versatile way is to configure `ghcide` in your
projects `shell.nix`. You probably already have a list with other dev tools you
use in there, like `with haskellPackages; [ hlint brittany ghcide ]`. Just add
`ghcide` in that list and you are good to go. See e.g. [this post for a recent
discussion about a Haskell dev setup with
nix](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-haskell-development-2020/6170). If you
are stuck with an old nixpkgs version, have a look at the end of part 4.

#### Pros

* Easy to setup
* Builds ghcide with the same ghc binary as your project, so no danger of
  incompatabilities between ghc and ghcide.

#### Cons

* We only have released versions of ghcide in nixpkgs. If you use
  nixpkgs-stable it might not even be the last release.
* When you use another `ghc` version than the default in your nixpkgs version,
  nix will compile ghcide on your computer because it isn‘t build by hydra.
  (build times are totally fine though.)

### ghcide-nix

You can import the `ghcide-nix` repo as a derivation and install the ghcide
from there. Consult the README for more details.

#### Pros

* Cached binaries for all supported `ghc` versions via cachix.
* Always a recent version from the ghcide master branch.
* Definitely recommended when you are already using the `haskell.nix`
  infrastructure for your project.

#### Cons

* Danger of incompatibilities, when your nixpkgs version and the pinned one of
  `ghcide-nix` don‘t match.
* Not compatible with a patched ghc, which is not build for the `haskell.nix`
  infrastructure.
* Larger nix store closure.

**EDIT:** I have been made aware of an alternative method to install `ghcide`
with `haskell.nix`:

> you can add it to a haskell.nix shell (one created with the `shellFor`
> function) with `x.shellFor { tools = { ghcide = "0.2.0"; }; }`. This will
> build `ghcide` with the `ghc` version in the shell.

Have a look at the `haskell.nix` documentation for more details.

### Configuration and Setup

Of course, after installing you need to test `ghcide` and possible write a
`hie.yaml` file to get `ghcide` to work with a specific project. This is
not very nix specific and will probably change in the future, so I don‘t dive
into it right now. Consult the readmes of
[`ghcide`](https://github.com/digital-asset/ghcide) and
[`hie-bios`](https://github.com/mpickering/hie-bios).

There is though one point to note here and that is package discovery. `ghcide`
needs to know all the places that `ghc` uses to lookup dependencies. When (and
I think only when) you use the `ghc.withPackages` function from `nixpkgs` the
dependencies are provided to `ghc` via environment variables set in a wrapper
script. In general `ghcide` will not know about this variables and fail to find
dependencies.
E.g.:

```
Step 4/6, Cradle 1/2: Loading GHC Session
ghcide: <command line>: cannot satisfy -package-id aeson-1.4.7.1-5lFE4NI0VYBHwz75Ema9FX
```

To prevent this you need to find a way to set those environment variables when
starting `ghcide`. [I have a PR
underway](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/89450) which should do this for
you if you install `ghcide` by putting it in the same `withPackages` list.

## 3. The nixpkgs Haskell ecosytem and dependency resolution

This section might be slightly off-topic here, so feel free to skip it. I think
this is really useful to know if you work with Haskell and nixpkgs and I regard
it as necessary context to understand the fix outlined in part 4.

### Haskell dependency resolution in general

Dependency resolution problems have a long history in Haskell, but today there
are two solutions that both work quite well in general.

1. Specify upper and lower bounds for every dependency in your cabal file and
   let cabal figure out a build plan. The times of cabal hell are over and this
   works quite well. Notably this is the way ghcide is supposed to be compiled
   in general.
2. Pin a stack LTS release for your dependencies and pin the version for
   packages not on stackage.

Now solution two is in some sense less complex to use, because at compile time
you don‘t need to construct a build plan. Of course, as I said, today cabal can
do this for you very smoothly, which is why I personally prefer the first
approach.

### Haskell in nixpkgs - pkgs.hackagePackages

So how does nixpkgs do it? Well basically solution two. Everyday [a
cronjob](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/commit/0a566a5777264e58fbfc259cb6453a9685dc5bfb)
pulls a list of **all packages from a pinned stack LTS release** and creates a
derivation for every one of them. It also pulls **all other packages from
hackage** and creates a derivation for the **latest released version** of them.
(This happens on the [haskell-updates branch of
nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/compare/haskell-updates) which get‘s
normally merged into nixpkgs master i.e. unstable [once per
week](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/88894). So then, you ask, how does
cabal2nix do dependency resolution? Well the short form is, it doesn‘t.  What I
mean by that is: It completely ignores any version bounds given in a cabal file
or a pinned stack LTS release. It will just **take the one version of every
dependency that is present in nixpkgs** by the method I told you above.

When I first learned about this I thought this was ludicrous.  This is prone to
fail. And indeed it does. For a large number of packages the build will either
fail at compile time or more often cabal will complain that it can‘t create a
build plan. What that actually means: cabal says the one build plan we provided
it with is invalid because it does not match the given version bounds.  duh. So
that packages get automatically marked broken after hydra, the nixos build
server, fails to build them. And oh boy, [there are a lot of Haskell packages
broken in
nixpkgs](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/blob/0a566a5777264e58fbfc259cb6453a9685dc5bfb/pkgs/development/haskell-modules/configuration-hackage2nix.yaml#L2647-L10970).

Before grasping how this setup comes together, [I was very frustrated by
this](https://discourse.nixos.org/t/nix-and-the-haskell-eco-system-a-match-made-in-heaven-or-a-difficult-relationship/3314).
And I guess for others casually encountering broken Haskell packages in
nixpkgs, without understanding this setup can be annoying.

What could be a suitable alternative to this for nixpkgs? Tough to say. We
could try to use some solution like the go, rust or node ecosystem and check in
a build plan for every package. Actually that can be a nice solution and if you
are interested in that you should definitely checkout the `haskell.nix`
infrastructure.
But that really does not go well together with providing all of hackage in
nixpkgs. For starters having every version of every Haskell package in nixpkgs
would already be very verbose. And Haskell dependency resolution is structured
in a way that in one build all dependencies have to agree on the version of
mutual further dependencies.  That means two build plans that use the same
version of one package might still need different builds of that package.  As a
result it could very well happen that your project could not profit a lot from
the nixpkgs binary cache even when it had precompiled every version of every
Haskell package.

There can probably be said a lot more about this, but I have accepted that the
chosen solution in nixpkgs actually has a lot of advantages (mainly fewer
compilation work for everyone) and I actually haven‘t encountered a package I
couldn‘t get to build with nixpkgs. The truth is the best guess build plan
nixpkgs provides us with is normally not very far away from a working build
plan. And it actually is a reasonable build plan. As a Haskell developer I
think it is a good rule of thumb to always make your project work with the
newest versions of all dependencies on hackage. And then it‘s very likely that
your package will also work in nixpkgs.

Above I complained that a lot of Haskell packages are broken in nixpkgs. In
truth, all commonly used packages work and most other packages are very easy to
fix.

## 4. Building ghcide with nixpkgs

So what can we do to fix a broken package on nixpkgs?

### How to fix broken Haskell builds in nixpkgs in general

[(Also watch this video if you are interested in
this).](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KLhkAEk8I20)

1. Often the error is actually fixed by an upstream version bound change, so
   you can always just try to compile the package. If it works make a PR
   against nixpkgs to remove the broken flag.
2. Often the problem is that the package can actually build with the supplied
   build plan but cabal doesn‘t believe us. So we can do a "jailbreak" and just
   tell cabal to ignore the version constraints. We don‘t do this by default
   because even if the package builds, it might now have changed semantics
   because of a change in a dependency. So a jailbreaked package should be tested
   and reported upstream so that the cabal restrictions of that package can get
   fixed.
3. If those two don‘t help we can still override the build plan manually to use
   different versions of the dependencies, not the ones provided by nixpkgs by
   default.

And the third option is what needed to be done for ghcide.

### Fixing the ghcide build in nixpkgs

There were the following problems [on
nixpkgs-20.03](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/86659):

* `hie-bios` was broken because of failing tests. Test fails during nix builds
  are very often false positives, so I disabled the tests.
* `ghcide` needed `regex-tdfa` and `haddock-library` newer than in the
  stack-lts. So I just used newer versions of those two libraries. This was not
  necessary on the `haskell-updates` branch because it uses a new enough stack
  lts release.
* `ghcide` pins the version of `haskell-lsp` and `haskell-lsp-types`. This will
  probably be the reason why maintaining `ghcide` in nixpkgs will always be a
  little bit of manual work because, it would have to be by chance _exactly_
  the `haskell-lsp` version from the stack lts release, to work without manual
  intervention.

So in summary only very few lines of code were needed to get `ghcide` to work.
If you are curious look at [the
commit](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/86765). It

* enables the generation of `haskell-lsp` and `haskell-lsp-types` 0.19.
* uses those packages as dependencies for `ghcide`
* disables test for `hie-bios`
* and marks `ghcide` and `hie-bios` as unbroken.

### Fixing the ghcide build via overrides

Sometimes you are stuck with an older nixpkgs version.  E.g. I wanted `ghcide`
to work with my obelisk project. Obelisk uses a pinned nixpkgs version _and_ a
patched ghc. So what I did was putting the overrides I describe above as
overrides into my projects `default.nix`. That‘s always a nice way to first
figure out how to fix a dependency, but of course you help a lot more people if
you find a way to upstream the fixes into nixpkgs.

I had to manually create some of the packages with a function called
`callHackageDirect` because the nixpkgs version in reflex-platform was so old.
It’s kinda the last way out, but it is very flexible and should be enough to
solve most dependency issues. If nothing else helps, create a build plan with
cabal and reproduce it by hand with nix overrides. That actually worked for me,
when [I tried to get ghcide to run with
obelisk.](https://github.com/obsidiansystems/obelisk/issues/660#issuecomment-594277283)

## Final remarks

Thank you for following me this long. I hope I have illuminated a bit the
situation with getting Haskell packages and `ghcide` specifically to run under
nixpkgs. If someday you meet a broken Haskell package in nixpkgs you now
hopefully know why, and how to fix it, or at least that fixing it is probably
not hard and you should give it a shot.

Installing `ghcide` for sure isn’t hard anymore. It even works in fairly custom
special case development situations like obelisk. So my recommendation is, set
it up right now, you won’t want to work without it anymore.

In this post I have touched a lot of topics, which could all use more concrete
how-to explanations, and on all of them I am far from an expert. So if you
think something is amiss or if you don’t understand something feel free to
contact me and maybe we can clarify it.

A big thank you to everyone involved with ghcide, nixpkgs or obelisk who helped
me with figuring all of this out! The nice people you meet are what actually
makes all of this so much fun.

I personally am definitely looking forward to the first official release of
haskell-language-server and I am sure we can land it in nixpkgs quickly.
[ghcide 0.2.0 will probably be
merged](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/89447) into [nixpkgs
master](https://github.com/NixOS/nixpkgs/pull/89456) around the same time that
this post is getting released.
